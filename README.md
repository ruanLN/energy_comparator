### Description

This project is intended to read the HDF file provided by ESB networks about my smart meter so i can compute how much a period would have cost with different energy plans

Did it need to be done in rust? No, but I was wanting to increase my Rust exposure
Do I have future plans for this project? Maybe providing this as an API so others can use, or providing to somethink like bonkers or switcher so they can provide user based optimal price plans
